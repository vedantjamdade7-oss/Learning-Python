# Tuple in Python
# The tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.

mytuple = (1,2,3,4)
print(mytuple)
print(type(mytuple))

# create tuple
# 1 using parenthesis

my_tuple = (1,"vedant",True,3.11)
print(my_tuple)

# 2 without parenthesis
tuple = 1,2,3,4,5,6
print(tuple)

# 3 tuple constructor
# t1 = tuple([2, 3, 4])
# print(t1)

# list = [1,2,3,4]
# new_tuple = tuple(list)
# print(new_tuple)

# create a single element
a = ("a",) # add comm
print(type(a))
